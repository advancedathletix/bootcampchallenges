# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this project I needed to make the top links in the header jump to the correct spot on the web page when clicking on them
I did this by adding id="search-engine-optimization" to the html 

I also needed to change the size of the content boxes on the right side of the page 
I did this by adding in a width tag and making it 860

I needed to change the top back ground image to match the example in the challenge work explanation 
I did this by increaseing the height to 1300px

I needed to change the right side content box to match the image in the challenge explanation
I did this by changing the width to 13% and then added P tags to make sure the content lined up with the images

I also changed the footer from h2 to h6 to make it
